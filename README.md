JeoGongTong is an app that provides an environment to study for people who do not have an environment to study or have difficulty studying on their own.

## 🐽  Introduction
Studying has become a key component of society throughout history. Nevertheless, there are many people who have difficulty learning due to environmental or personal factors. In order to overcome these problems, the low-common app offers new solutions. The app promotes learning motivation by providing a space for people who share the same goal to study together. It gives learning fun through a game-like tier and ranking system, and interactions through questionnaires help students understand what they are learning without a teacher.

Through JeoGongTong, society gains important benefits that can improve accessibility and efficiency of education. The app contributes to narrowing the knowledge gap by building a sense of solidarity among learners and encouraging continuous learning. In addition, learning through pleasure makes the absorption of knowledge easier, which will ultimately contribute to raising the educational level of society as a whole. The innovative learning environment that low commonality provides hopes to create a world where everyone can dream and realize a better future through education
